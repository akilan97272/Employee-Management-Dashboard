WAF INTEGRATION
==============
Placeholder for Web Application Firewall configuration guidance.

WHY:
- WAF blocks common web exploits (SQLi/XSS/bots) before they reach the app.

HOW:
- Deploy behind a WAF (e.g., Cloudflare/Azure WAF) and route traffic through it.
- Optionally validate WAF headers or tokens here if your provider supports it.
